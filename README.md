# Social Playlist

Social Playlist is a web application that allows you to play music with
friends. You can search for any song/sound on SoundCloud and add it to a
collaborative playlist. Then, you and your friends can all decide on the order
by 'upvoting' or 'downvoting' songs.

Social Playlist is built with the node.js framework. So, install it on your
computer with `npm install`, and run the application with `node app.js`.
